        <p>
            After setting up a remote <a href="http://www.cups.org/">CUPS print server</a> in my dorm's network
            the question arose how to configure different clients to use it. On Windows the main challenge was to find the right driver 
            (in the end "Generic > MS Publisher Color Printer" worked) on MacOS setting up the printer was straight forward as printing on MacOS
            is also based on CUPS. As iOS shares a lot of internals with MacOS it first also seemed straightforward.
            Unfortunately there is one small difference on iOS: There are no printing settings (for reasons I do not know nor understand). 
            Instead iOS solely supports printing via "AirPrint printers which magically appear in the printing dialog automatically". 
            According to Apple one needs an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201387">"AirPrint-enabled printer"</a> to print via iOS,
            which is not really helpful if one wants to support remote printing in a larger network (on "AirPrint-enabled" printers). 
            Fortunately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPrint">Wikipedia knows more</a> about AirPrint's technical details,
            mentioning <i>Bonjour</i>, <i>DNS-SD</i>, <i>Apple Raster</i> and <i>IPP</i> and so does <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/CUPSAirPrint">The Debian Wiki</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>IPP</h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol">Internet Printing Protocol</a> (IPP) defines how print clients can talk to printers via 
            HTTP to manage print jobs. A walk through can be found in the <a href="https://www.pwg.org/ipp/ippguide.html">IPP Guide</a>.
            When creating a print job, the client can send the file to print in different formats to the server (also called "printing description language" [PDL]). Among the formats are PDF and JPEG,
            so those can be directly sent to the printer without any conversion step in-between. Given that CUPS is an IPP implementation and all the other operating systems were also already printing via IPP
            this seemed to be already working just fine. It's also interesting to note that the author of Apple CUPS, Michael R. Sweet is also the secretary of the IPP specification
            and continues to work on CUPS at the <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/cups/#HISTORY">OpenPrinting fork of CUPS</a>. 
        </p>
        <h3>Apple Raster (URF)</h3>
        <p>
            According to the OpenPrinting work group's <a href="https://openprinting.github.io/driverless/01-standards-and-their-pdls/">documentation</a>,
            both "IPP Everywhere" and "AirPrint" specify the use of DNS-SD for printer discovery, IPP for communication and both support PDF and JPEG as PDLs.
            The only difference between those standards lies in the supported raster format, "IPP Everywhere" uses the open source "PWG raster format" whereas 
            AirPrint uses "Universal Raster Format (URF)" also called "Apple Raster". Additionally "[URF] is similar to CUPS and PWG Raster but with much simpler page header". 
            So for a long time CUPS used a different raster format than AirPrint, and Michael R. Sweet noted on <a href="https://github.com/apple/cups/issues/4341">Apple's CUPS issue tracker</a>:
            "Sorry, but we do not support AirPrint for shared printers served by CUPS.". Interestingly support for URF was added to CUPS for MacOS and iOS via 
            closed source additions and was never officially supported. Fortunately after Sweet left Apple, <a href="https://github.com/OpenPrinting/cups/pull/126">OpenPrinting CUPS suddenly supported URF and other AirPrint specific IPP attributes</a>.
            As the printer behind the print server also supports URF it seems that printing URF files via OpenPrinting CUPS also seems to work just fine.
            Thus although Apple Raster is not publicly documented (neither is AirPrint) it still seems to be supported by CUPS. Therefore if iOS would actually 
            find the printer and show it, one would also be able to print with iOS.
        </p>
        <h3>Bonjour</h3>
        <p>
            Bonjour is Apple's implementation of the concept of "zero configuration", based on various standards published by the <a href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">IETF Zeroconf Working Group</a>. 
            The main idea of Zeroconf is to store configuration information for any kind of service in a tree of DNS records (specified as DNS based Service Discovery (DNS-SD)).
            In the absence of an authoritative DNS server, each client in a link-local network serves their own services via DNS,
            and each client then broadcasts to all other clients via multicast DNS (mDNS). Thus when an iPhone (or any other device running Bonjour or another Zeroconf implementation) connects to a network,
            it broadcasts a DNS request to all devices in the local network (e.g. a printer) and then receives configuration via DNS responses.
            It then uses the response to request further configuration entries recursively on services it is interested in. 

            Fortunately CUPS also <a href="https://www.cups.org/doc/sharing.html">supports DNS-SD</a> (by setting "Browsing Yes"), 
            and afterwards the printer magically appeared in iOS devices in the <i>same local network</i>. As each resident in our dorm 
            has it's own local network and the printers have yet another, this approach didn't quite scale. Fortunately DNS-SD also specifies 
            a "wide area" mode and a quick search for "wide area bonjour" suggested that Bonjour also supports that.

            Unfortunately though, iOS itself provides no way to debug Bonjour, if something is not quite right the printer simply does not show up in the list of printers.
            There is an app in the app store though which at least provides some insights into what iOS does (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/discovery-dns-sd-browser/id305441017">Discovery</a>). 
            With that the journey began to turn the local DNS-SD service into a wide area service.

            The starting point is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_domain">search domain</a> which is distributed via DHCP to clients 
            when the network is set up and which Bonjour uses as the root domain for DNS-SD (let's say it is "example.corp").
            This is then used by Bonjour (and other DNS-SD clients) to check whether the search domain provides wide area DNS SD.
            This is generally done by prefixing the search domain with some well-known subdomains,
            and DNS-SD in local networks works exactly the same but uses the ".local" domain (and broadcasts via mDNS).
            First the client retrieves a list of domains to use for further DNS-SD queries,
              which generally is the domain itself (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763.html#section-11">spec</a>).
    
        </p>
        <div class="shell">
            » dig +short <b>b._dns-sd._udp.</b>example.corp PTR<br>
            example.corp.
        </div>

        <p>
            Specifying that alone didn't work though, iOS simply ignored this domain and did not continue searching.
            There is another domain used for domain enumeration for "legacy browsing". The specification states:
            "Sophisticated client applications that care to present choices of
            domain to the user use the answers learned from the previous four
            queries to discover the domains to present.  In contrast, many
            current applications browse without specifying an explicit domain,
            allowing the operating system to automatically select an
            appropriate domain on their behalf.  It is for this class of
            application that the "automatic browsing" query is provided, to
            allow the network administrator to communicate to the client
            operating systems which domain(s) should be used automatically for
            these applications.".
            Thus after setting the <i>lb._dns-sd._udp.</i> entry, Bonjour started with service type enumeration (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763.html#section-9">spec</a>).
            Here we're announcing the availability of IPP services. And then provide the concrete IPP services (the printers available on the print server). 
        </p>
        <div class="shell">
            » dig +short <b>lb._dns-sd._udp</b>.example.corp PTR<br>
            example.corp.<br>
            <br>
            » dig +short <b>_services._dns-sd._udp</b>.example.corp PTR<br>
            _ipp._tcp.example.corp.<br>
            <br>
            » dig +short <b>_ipp._tcp</b>.example.corp PTR<br>
            color._ipp._tcp.example.corp.<br>
            no-color._ipp._tcp.example.corp.<br>
        </div>

        <p>
            As a small side note, we are announcing two different virtual printers "color" and "nocolor", as not all clients provide a reliable way to set the ColorMode,
            and providing two printers with different settings was the easiest way to provide this across devices. Now unfortunately iOS did not show the printers.
            A <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/airplay-payload-settings-dep5e646123a/1/web/1.0">small note in the Apple documentation</a> provided the missing piece:
            "AirPrint devices don’t browse for all IPP printers—they browse only for the subset of IPP printers that support Universal Raster Format (URF).". 
            Thus iOS actually browses the <i>_universal._sub.</i> <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763.html#section-7.1">subtype</a> of IPP.
        </p>
        <div class="shell">
            » dig +short <b>_universal._sub</b>._ipp._tcp.example.corp PTR<br>
            color._ipp._tcp.example.corp.<br>
            no-color._ipp._tcp.example.corp.<br>
        </div>

        <p>
            Now for each of these printers the printers address and port is looked up (which is 631 for IPP) looking up the SRV record,
            and some basic configuration via the TXT record. These were simply taken over by what CUPS announced locally. 
            And then magically the printers finally appeared on all Apple devices in the network.

            0 0 631 print-server.example.corp<br>
            <br>
